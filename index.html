  <span class='ok'>Ok,</span>
  <span class='the-deal'>so here's the deal:</span>
</div>
<div id='story'>
  <p>We've been turning non-programmers into programmers
  and beginning programmers into better programers 
  for five years now.</p>

  <p>For free.</p>

  <p id='nice-things'>We're excited about our work; nothing makes us happier
  than sharing this excitement with you. Alumni over
  the years have said a lot of nice things about us.
  <span class='reference-to-quotes' />
  </p>

  <p>But a lot has changed in five years: three venue switches,
  several new jobs, more client projects, grad school, and
  increased demand for the skills we're teaching.</p>

  <p>To keep providing the level of quality you deserve
  we've got to start charging. Money keeps it real.
  Money keeps us serious about teaching. Money keeps you
  serious about learning.</p>

  <p>How much money?</p>

  <p>We don't know. We're going to let you decide.
  Pick a class, sign up, and tell us what it's worth to you.
  $5? $500? $5000? Your call.</p>

  <p>Registration will be open for two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, we'll
  choose a group of top bidders and charge them the lowest amount from the group.</p>
